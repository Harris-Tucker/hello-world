## A bit about myself

I am a Junior at Northern Arizona University studying Data Science. My anticipated graduation date is May of 2025. I am the founder and president of a fraternity on campus named Delta Tau Delta. I am also the number one Amateur 140lb Muay Thai fighter in the state of Arizona. I have a record of 4-2. However, my record within the weight class is 3-0 with two wins by knockout.
